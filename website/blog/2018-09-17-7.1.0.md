## Highlights

### Decorators (Stage 2)

```js
class MyClass {
  @decorator
  method() {}
}
```

It's been many years in the making, but thanks to the amazing [work](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/7976) by [Nicolò](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo), this release includes initial support for Stage 2 decorators (via `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`). Shoutout to [Peeyush](https://github.com/peey) for implementing parser support (and initial transform work) during [Google Summer of Code](https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/08/11/gsoc-peey-1) last year and thanks to many members of TC39 including [Daniel](https://github.com/littledan), [Kevin](https://github.com/bakkot), and [Diego](https://github.com/diervo) for their reviews.

Please check out our separate [blog post](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/09/17/decorators) for more information regarding some history, changes from the previous proposal, and what's next!
